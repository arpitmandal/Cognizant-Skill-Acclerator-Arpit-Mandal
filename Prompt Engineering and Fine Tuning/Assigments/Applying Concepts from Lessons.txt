Part 1: Techniques in Prompt Optimization
Multiple Choice Questions:

Which of the following is the most effective way to improve prompt clarity?
Correct Answer: B) Provide detailed instructions and examples.
What does it mean to "assign the AI a role" in a prompt?
Correct Answer: B) Guide the AI's tone and perspective by specifying a persona.

Reflection:
Prompt optimization would streamline my content creation workflow significantly. By developing template prompts with specific parameters for tone, length, and structure, I could generate higher-quality first drafts of marketing materials and blog posts that require minimal editing. Including examples of my preferred style would help the AI match my voice, while role-based prompts would enable me to generate content from different perspectives for various marketing personas. This transforms AI from a generic tool into a customized assistant that understands my specific needs and preferences.
Part 2: Debugging Prompt Failures
True/False Questions:

A prompt that is too broad or vague is more likely to produce irrelevant responses. TRUE
Debugging prompts involves refining the AI model, not the input provided. FALSE

Reflection:
In healthcare communication, a poorly crafted prompt like "explain treatment options for diabetes" without specifying the type of diabetes or audience could lead to dangerous generalized advice. I would debug this by specifying the exact condition (Type 2 diabetes), defining the audience (newly diagnosed patients), setting boundaries on information to include/exclude, requesting appropriate medical disclaimers, and specifying an accessible language level. These refinements would produce information that is both accurate and appropriate for patient education, reducing misunderstandings that could affect treatment.
Part 3: Evaluating Prompt Effectiveness
Fill in the Blank:

To evaluate prompt effectiveness, key metrics include relevance, clarity, and completeness.
A response's relevance measures how well it aligns with the task's requirements, while completeness assesses whether all parts of the request are addressed.

Reflection:
Evaluating prompt effectiveness significantly improves my productivity in academic research. When using AI for literature reviews, the difference between vague and well-evaluated prompts can save hours of work. By systematically assessing metrics like relevance and completeness, I ensure AI focuses on methodology and findings rather than background information. This creates a valuable feedback loop that improves both the AI's performance and my skill in crafting prompts, making our collaboration increasingly efficient over time and reducing frustrating back-and-forth exchanges.
