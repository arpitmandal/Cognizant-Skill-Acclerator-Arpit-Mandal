Explanation of the Code
Part 1: Fine-Tuning BERT
Dataset: Loads the IMDb dataset and tokenizes it using bert-base-uncased.
Model: Uses BertForSequenceClassification with 2 labels (positive/negative).
Training: Sets up a Trainer with hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate 2e-5, 3 epochs) and trains the model. Training logs are saved automatically.
Deliverable: The code itself, training logs in ./logs, and a saved model in ./bert-finetuned-imdb-final.
Part 2: Debugging Issues
Issue: Simulates overfitting by using a small dataset subset. Debugs by lowering the learning rate (1e-5), increasing regularization (weight_decay=0.1), and reducing epochs (2).
Process: Re-trains the model and compares validation performance (visible in logs).
Deliverable: Initial issue (overfitting), debugging steps (hyperparameter adjustments), and improved results (via logs).
Part 3: Evaluating the Model
Predictions: Generates predictions on a test subset.
Metrics: Computes accuracy and F1-score using the evaluate library.
Refinement: Adjusts batch size (to 16) and re-trains to improve stability, then re-evaluates.
Deliverable: Metrics before and after refinement, with a reflection in the console output.
Part 4: Creative Application
Task: Classifies short customer reviews as positive or negative.
Implementation: Uses the fine-tuned model on a custom dataset, showcasing real-world applicability.
Deliverable: Final model, predictions, and a summary of techniques (fine-tuning, inference).
